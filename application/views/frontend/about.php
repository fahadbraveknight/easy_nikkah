	<p>Easy Nikah previously known as <b>SubhanAllah Matrimony</b> managed by <b>Asif Dange</b> (Vashi Navi-Mumbai) started the match making 
	services way back in August 2014 to assist the families who are looking for a suitable match for their children.</p>
	<p>There were 2 separate forms which used to filled by males and females and the details were captured and sent across to 
	all registered members on email in excel sheet. Since all the details were sent in excel there was no privacy for the 
	registered members and they would receive calls directly from the ones who didn't fit their criteria and also the email id
	 and contact details were open to all.</p>
	<p>Easy Nikah takes the confidentiality and privacy of the registered members to the next level by keeping the email id 
	and contact details of the registered members private unless they accept the proposal from any suitable match. Once the 
	proposal is accepted then the contact details would be visible to each other and then they can take things ahead In sha Allah.</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> We don't have any office where you can meet us as everything is Alhamdulilah managed online. You can get in touch 
	with us on the details mentioned in Contact Us page.</p>
	<p>Once you register at Easy Nikah your email id would be added to our SubhanAllah Google email group. SubhanAllah email 
	group shall send daily Islamic emails on your email id along with other updates of the initiatives and activities which are 
	being done to assist Muslim brothers and sisters.</p>
